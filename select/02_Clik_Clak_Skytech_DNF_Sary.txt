Clik clak, clik clak
Do another tiktok
We got one shot now
Like gear, slash hair
You know that I don't care
What I want is love

There's one thing that I need
Get some love on my feed
Keeping up, my head help up high

Clik clak, clik clak

Clik clak, another round

Clik clak, clik clak

Big eyes, nice butt
You know how to get cut
Boom, the lightning strikes
