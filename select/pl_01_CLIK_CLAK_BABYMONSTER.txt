Walking like a boss boss boss
We make ’em talk talk talk talk
I need a van to hold all my bags
Always the first

Here with my girls

We do it big you know

If I say which one looks better
You say both (both) both (both)
I’m bad from any angle
Hit that pose (pose) pose (pose)
Matching tennis bracelets
Baby blue water vacations
I’ll admit that I’m so vicious
No I ain’t the one to play with
Everybody wanna know oh oh
Bitty burning up the show oh oh
Eenie meenie miney moe

Get back whip that they mad
Clap clap bring that ASAP
If they all up in
their feelings that’s too bad
I be laughing to the bank
in my Maybach
Left hand kiss that big rock
Tunnel vision
twenty twenty top notch
Spent a milly
on some fits I’m so hot
Put some ice on
my wrist that’s water
I’m on it on it
got it flaunt it
Got your world in my pocket
Zero hundred like Ferrari
Hit the gas
Who gon’ stop me
You love when BABYMONSTER hits
Cartier stacked up on my wrist
Flip my hair and blow a kiss
Not a dentist
but I’m flossin’ sis
